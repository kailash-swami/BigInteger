# BigInteger

This project is an implementation of a BigInteger (BigInt) library in C++ that supports mathematical operations on integers of arbitrary size, beyond the limits of built-in data types (int, long long, etc.).

It is designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation and operator overloading, making it intuitive and easy to use.


## âœ¨ Features

âœ… Store integers of unlimited size

âœ… Support for negative numbers

âœ… Basic arithmetic operations:

Addition (+)

Subtraction (âˆ’)

Multiplication (Ã—)

Division (Ã·)

Modulus (%)

âœ… Comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)

âœ… Assignment and copy support

âœ… Input/Output stream support (cin, cout)
